In particular you can add spatial indexes to already located data, and perform spatial operations on the data like searching for data within specified regions or within a specified distance of a point of interest. In addition classes are provided to expose the data to geotools and thereby to geotools enabled applications like geoserver and uDig.","fork":false,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/neo4j-contrib/spatial","keys_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/neo4j-contrib/spatial/keys{/key_id}","collaborators_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/neo4j-contrib/spatial/collaborators{/collaborator}","teams_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/neo4j-contrib/spatial/teams","hooks_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/neo4j-contrib/spatial/hooks","issue_events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/neo4j-contrib/spatial/issues/events{/number}","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/neo4j-contrib/spatial/events","assignees_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/neo4j-contrib/spatial/assignees{/user}","branches_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/neo4j-contrib/spatial/branches{/branch}","tags_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/neo4j-contrib/spatial/tags","blobs_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/neo4j-contrib/spatial/git/blobs{/sha}","git_tags_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/neo4j-contrib/spatial/git/tags{/sha}","git_refs_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/neo4j-contrib/spatial/git/refs{/sha}","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/neo4j-contrib/spatial/statuses/{sha}","languages_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/neo4j-contrib/spatial/languages","stargazers_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/neo4j-contrib/spatial/stargazers","contributors_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/neo4j-contrib/spatial/contributors","subscription_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/neo4j-contrib/spatial/subscription","commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/neo4j-contrib/spatial/commits{/sha}","git_commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/neo4j-contrib/spatial/git/commits{/sha}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/neo4j-contrib/spatial/comments{/number}","issue_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/neo4j-contrib/spatial/issues/comments{/number}","contents_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/neo4j-contrib/spatial/contents/{+path}","compare_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/neo4j-contrib/spatial/compare/{base}...{head}","merges_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/neo4j-contrib/spatial/merges","archive_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/neo4j-contrib/spatial/{archive_format}{/ref}","downloads_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/neo4j-contrib/spatial/downloads","issues_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/neo4j-contrib/spatial/issues{/number}","pulls_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/neo4j-contrib/spatial/pulls{/number}","milestones_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/neo4j-contrib/spatial/milestones{/number}","notifications_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/neo4j-contrib/spatial/notifications{?since,all,participating}","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/neo4j-contrib/spatial/labels{/name}","releases_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/neo4j-contrib/spatial/releases{/id}","created_at":"2010-02-10T15:23:02Z","updated_at":"2015-12-11T01:36:52Z","pushed_at":"2015-12-02T14:53:15Z","git_url":"git://github.com/neo4j-contrib/spatial.git","ssh_url":"git@github.com:neo4j-contrib/spatial.git","clone_url":"https://github.com/neo4j-contrib/spatial.git","svn_url":"https://github.com/neo4j-contrib/spatial","homepage":"","size":6522,"stargazers_count":380,"watchers_count":380,"language":"Scheme","has_issues":true,"has_downloads":true,"has_wiki":true,"has_pages":true,"forks_count":137,"open_issues_count":66,"forks":137,"open_issues":66,"watchers":380,"default_branch":"master","permissions":{"admin":false,"push":false,"pull":true},"organization":{"login":"neo4j-contrib","id":916372,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/916372?v\u003d3","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/neo4j-contrib","html_url":"https://github.com/neo4j-contrib","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neo4j-contrib/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neo4j-contrib/following{/other_user}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neo4j-contrib/starred{/owner}{/repo}","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neo4j-contrib/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neo4j-contrib/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neo4j-contrib/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neo4j-contrib/received_events","type":"Organization","site_admin":false},"network_count":137,"subscribers_count":88}

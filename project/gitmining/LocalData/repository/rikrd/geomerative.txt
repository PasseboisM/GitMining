It extends 2D geometry operations to facilitate generative geometry. Includes a TrueType font and an SVG interpreters. This library exposes the shapes (such as vector drawings or typographies) in a more approchable way. Geomerative makes it easy to access the contours, the control points and the curve points, making it easy to develop generative typography and geometry pieces in Processing.","fork":false,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rikrd/geomerative","keys_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rikrd/geomerative/keys{/key_id}","collaborators_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rikrd/geomerative/collaborators{/collaborator}","teams_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rikrd/geomerative/teams","hooks_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rikrd/geomerative/hooks","issue_events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rikrd/geomerative/issues/events{/number}","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rikrd/geomerative/events","assignees_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rikrd/geomerative/assignees{/user}","branches_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rikrd/geomerative/branches{/branch}","tags_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rikrd/geomerative/tags","blobs_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rikrd/geomerative/git/blobs{/sha}","git_tags_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rikrd/geomerative/git/tags{/sha}","git_refs_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rikrd/geomerative/git/refs{/sha}","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rikrd/geomerative/statuses/{sha}","languages_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rikrd/geomerative/languages","stargazers_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rikrd/geomerative/stargazers","contributors_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rikrd/geomerative/contributors","subscription_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rikrd/geomerative/subscription","commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rikrd/geomerative/commits{/sha}","git_commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rikrd/geomerative/git/commits{/sha}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rikrd/geomerative/comments{/number}","issue_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rikrd/geomerative/issues/comments{/number}","contents_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rikrd/geomerative/contents/{+path}","compare_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rikrd/geomerative/compare/{base}...{head}","merges_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rikrd/geomerative/merges","archive_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rikrd/geomerative/{archive_format}{/ref}","downloads_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rikrd/geomerative/downloads","issues_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rikrd/geomerative/issues{/number}","pulls_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rikrd/geomerative/pulls{/number}","milestones_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rikrd/geomerative/milestones{/number}","notifications_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rikrd/geomerative/notifications{?since,all,participating}","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rikrd/geomerative/labels{/name}","releases_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rikrd/geomerative/releases{/id}","created_at":"2008-06-27T21:48:18Z","updated_at":"2015-12-02T00:42:26Z","pushed_at":"2015-04-01T23:29:38Z","git_url":"git://github.com/rikrd/geomerative.git","ssh_url":"git@github.com:rikrd/geomerative.git","clone_url":"https://github.com/rikrd/geomerative.git","svn_url":"https://github.com/rikrd/geomerative","homepage":"http://www.ricardmarxer.com/geomerative","size":7472,"stargazers_count":75,"watchers_count":75,"language":"Java","has_issues":true,"has_downloads":true,"has_wiki":true,"has_pages":false,"forks_count":12,"open_issues_count":1,"forks":12,"open_issues":1,"watchers":75,"default_branch":"master","permissions":{"admin":false,"push":false,"pull":true},"network_count":12,"subscribers_count":14}

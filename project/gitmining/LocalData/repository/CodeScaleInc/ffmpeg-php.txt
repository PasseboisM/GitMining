It adds an easy to use, object-oriented API for accessing and retrieving information from video and audio files. It has methods for returning frames from movie files as images that can be manipulated using PHP\u0027s image functions. This works well for automatically creating thumbnail images from movies. FFmpegPHP is also useful for reporting the duration and bitrate of audio files (mp3, wma...). FFmpegPHP can access many of the video formats supported by ffmpeg (mov, avi, mpg, wmv...)
